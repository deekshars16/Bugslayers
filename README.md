# Intelligent Carbon Emission Management System (Django)

A Django-based web platform designed to monitor, analyze, and manage carbon emissions in real time. The system collects activity and usage data, processes it on the backend, and displays insights through interactive dashboards. It helps users track emission levels, identify high-emission sources, and take steps to reduce their carbon footprint.
